A Boilerplate is already set up for you with everything you will need to get started. This boilerplate is set up to use:

* [React](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html)
* [React Query](https://tanstack.com/query/v3/docs/react/overview)
* [Express](https://expressjs.com/en/api.html)

## Components (Client Side)
| name | purpose |
| --- | --- |
| Login | View for user to enter their login credentials |
| Register | View for user to sign up |
| Home | Welcome users and link to reviews |



## API (Client - Server)

| Method | Endpoint | Protected | Usage | Response |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Post | /api/auth/login | Yes | Log In a User | The Users JWT Token |
| Post | /api/auth/register | Yes | Register a User | The Users JWT Token |


## DB (Server Side) -


## Authentication

Authentication is already set up in the client side of this project using Auth0. Users are currently able to login and logout.

When you wish to protect your server side routes (those for registered users only), you may need to reference other exercises or materials.

If you wish to replace the Auth0 authentication with your own, so you can customise the login for example, you will need to update the `client/index.tsx` file of the project with your own Auth0 details.

## Setup

Run the following commands in your terminal:

```sh
npm install
npm run dev
```

To run before merging:
```sh
npm run lint
npm run format
npm run test
```
